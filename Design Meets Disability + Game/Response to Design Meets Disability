In "Design Meets Disability," Pullin argues that design for disabilities tends to be more focused on practicality and invisibility than in
appeal and aesthetic. In a way, they are meant to be concealed (or, in the case of prosthetics, "passing") rather than visible.

What does this mean for the question of "design"? Well, on a material basis, it means that the people designing things to help
differently-abled people become able-bodied are more focused on practicality and "normal use" than they are on the possibilities
inherent in the creation of glasses, hearing aids, or even prosthetic limbs.

Throughout the piece, I could not help but think about the cyberpunk genre of sci-fi, where one of the main staples is that of body
modification (this resonated particularly at the point where the mountain climber talks about making a leg prosthesis that can stretch
beyond what his legs or normal legs would be able to). That is to say, the design of these tools and prosthetics is open to all kinds
of body enhancements and a new language of body aesthetics, but the field is kept closed by the need to make everything "practical" but
plain as opposed to "practical" and aesthetic.

As for simplicity, it is also clear that the best way to do things is by universaling through simplicity of function and design rather
than skimping on one end of the equation.
