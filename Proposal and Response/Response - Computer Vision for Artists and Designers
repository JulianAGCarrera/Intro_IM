Response to Golan Levin's "Computer Vision for Artists and Designers"

Golan Levin's notes on computer vision prove to be helpful in understanding how a computer, using cameras, sees the world. Seeing, for us,
is a natural thing: we have eyes, we notice things, and we create an idea of the world around us from this vision. Thing is, even though
our brain takes images as wholes and processes them as such, it also enables us to have selective tunnel vision. Because of this, we can
focus on particular things and ignore other things. Apart from that, we also have pattern recognition that enables to pick out things from
other things without much trouble.

A computer linked to a camera, however, skips out on the majority of what I have just said. A computer with a camera just sees images as
wholes. It needs the additional programming to start recognising that the images it sees are made up of a collection of things, rather than
a collection of pixels. In other words, it needs to figure out how to tell the objects it sees apart from each other, and it does so
primarily by cross-checking what the background is (and, thus, pick out what is not background), the brightness levels, or shape.

The application of these tools allow for different programs to use cameras and track bodies, cars, movement, faces, races. It allows
for social commentary (or, more commonly, the existence of dystopic surveillance states). It is a double-sided blade that, on one hand.
allows new affordances for art and computation, but also allows for further invasions of privacy.
