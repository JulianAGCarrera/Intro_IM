Her Code Got Humans on the Moon â€” And Invented Software Itself (Reading Response)

The article goes through the origin of software by telling the story of Margaret Hamilton's involvement with the Apollo project. By
telling her story, the article shows the advancements of software from punching holes to writing code. It is an interesting
development, too, that the gendered spaces for coding education and practice seem to be, at least partially, the result of Margaret
Hamilton's work. Adding onto that, too, is the fact that the code has evolved to where it is thanks to her work. The biggest takeaway
for me is thankfulness that coding, though complicated, no longer relies on punching holes and manually making circuits with magnetic
rings.

The article is a lesson on planning for mistakes, too, considering the business with P01 and false assumptions of perfection around
what astronauts did. Though the article doesn't go into too much depth, it shows that it is better to fix mistakes than to leave them
and accidentally run into them, resulting in a rush to fix them when they could have been gone from the beginning. It is good that
the article shows the pros of testing the code over and over to see that whatever mistakes and problems can be ironed out before the
software is ready for use.
