What does computing mean to me at this point in my life?

While I have only recently learned basic coding and programming, computers (and the general idea of computing) have always been present
in my life. I grew up glued to computers, then when I grew up enough to properly read, I grew up glued to handhelds and home consoles
(the fact that I spent so much time on these things also helped me learn English, particularly because translating video games to Spanish
wasn't in vogue at the time). Growing up like this, exposed to multiple types of software made specifically for playing games, I developed
a solid idea of how their rules worked: what was possible and what wasn't. I learned how to "read" computing rules, to figure out what
things worked and what things didn't. Recently, I have been thinking a lot about video games (particularly visual novels) for my capstone,
so computing and its inherent rules are on my mind.

Now, I am taking two IM classes: Intro to IM and Games & Play. My relationship to Games & Play is more obvious. Intro to IM, however, has
helped me better understand how to make computers do things. Exploring this question through coding has also helped me with analysing
video games: I can now better theorise how things work through specific code examples. I don't know if my theorising will benefit anyone
in the long run, but at least now I have managed to introduce professors to video games (and visual novels, particularly) as forms
deserving analysis.

On a non-academic note, figuring out how computing works has helped me understand how hard it is to make a computer do anything. I can see
through a bit of how computers and cell phones work and why they sometimes don't work, or work slowly. Even thinking about it, however, is
hard: there are a thousand different ways to do things and all of them are complex and, to me, a literature student with one semester's
worth of programming experience, completely unintelligible.
